# BetStreams

BetStreams is a pay-per-view implementation using Livepeer and Superfluid to help creators monetize their content and for viewers to pay for what they see. Nothing more.
We are also using Uma protocol to create a short and long token pair to bet on what will happen in the Livestream.

For example, if a jump rope competition is happening on the livestream, viewers can buy a short or long with our token, BGX (short representing the jumper doesn't reach the goal, long representing a bet they make the goal). This implementation can be used for various use cases such as sporting events, reality television, and even public service announcements.

Here is an image of our tech stack:

Notifications with Push Protocol will be implemented to notify streamers of new viewers and to notify betters of the deadline. We also plan on using Streamr for a live video chat for better communication amongst peers.
